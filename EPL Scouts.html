    <h1>Chelsea interested in signing 24 years old Norwegian player</h1>
    <p>Chelsea are keen on signing Sheffield United midfielder Sander Berge, who will cost nearly €20m. The Norwegian midfielder has a deal with the Championship club until the summer of 2024 and he could be available for a reasonable price of €20m at the end of the campaign.

        Sander has impressed with his displays for Sheffield United this campaign, and he was quite impressive in the PL as well. Berge was expected to complete a move to a Premier League club at the start of the campaign as well. Liverpool showed interest in the 24-year-old midfielder, but he ended up staying with the Blades.
        
        
        It is no secret that Liverpool are in desperate need of midfield reinforcements, and Norway international could prove to be a quality acquisition. Sander has already played in the PL and could settle in quickly and make an immediate impact at Liverpool.
        
        Furthermore, the reported €20m asking price looks quite reasonable for a player of his quality as well. The Blues are keen on securing his services as well. The London giants could lose Jorginho and Kante at the end of the campaign, and Berge could be a quality replacement.
        
        Both Chelsea footballers will be out of contract at the end of the campaign and it remains to be seen whether Graham Potter’s side can agree on a deal with Sheffield. Chelsea certainly have more financial resources compared to Liverpool. And it will be interesting to see if Chelsea can fend off the competition from the Reds and secure his signature.</p>
